# Credit Product Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

The Credit Product Recommendation Engine is a sophisticated, machine learning-powered platform designed to deliver personalized credit product recommendations—such as credit cards, loans, mortgages, and insurance products—to both individual consumers and businesses. By leveraging comprehensive financial profiles, historical application data, and credit bureau integrations, the engine intelligently matches users with the best funding options tailored to their unique financial circumstances.

This project supports white labeling with flexible branding, offers interactive user features, and delivers actionable analytics to optimize recommendation success and platform performance. The architecture is built for scalability, security, and fast response times, making it suitable for modern financial technology ecosystems.
